
## Final Report

The final report should be no more than 8 pages including references and appendices. The report should focus on the process of your solving the challenges as well as the highlights of your techniques. Final reports should follow the format of a technical paper rather than a tutorial or plain description of how the team solved each challenge. The report is also an opportunity to impress the judges with your approach to the given problems as well as to highlight insights or how the team overcame difficulties in the challenge.



## Presentation

The ppt presentation is limited to ***10 slides***. The presentations must be sent to the organizers via email at **csaw-esc@nyu.edu** by 2 November 2020 at 11:59pm eastern time US. Presentations should follow a standard 4:3 PowerPoint presentation template.



## Video

The team video will be evaluated by the judges along with the final report and should be no more than 10 minutes. The video should highlight your approach, novel solutions, etc. Your video should be submitted using a **private Google Drive link** (anyone with the link outside your organization should be able to access it without login, but the video must remain private) along with the final report. The video link should be submitted in a clearly named, separate .txt file within the TAR.GZ files of the final submission in HotCRP.
